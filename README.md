### This project is based on Python 3.9 and torch 2，9.
  
  #### Training_and_Analysis/Baseline_model.py: Training and testing code for the baseline model.
  
  #### Training_and_Analysis/SNGP-*.py: Training and testing code for CA, LA, and ResMLP integrated with SNGP
  
  ####  Training_and_Analysis/CP-*: Conformal prediction code
  
  ####  Training_and_Analysis/OOD_Sample_Analysis-*: t-SNE, LDA, and SHAP analysis
  
  ####  Training_and_Analysis/Generate_sample_detection-*: Generate sample detection
  
  #### Temporal_Robustness_Test/Time_robustness_test-SNGP-*: Monthly time robustness test performance
  
  #### Temporal_Robustness_Test/Time_robustness_test-CP-*: Monthly conformal prediction

  #### The data directory contains the required data, and we have also provided the pre-trained model weights.
