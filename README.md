# Hazardous-waste-generation

### This project is based on R 4.2.3 and Python 3.9.

  #### model_data.csv: data used for model building in this project.
  
  #### Sampling to split test and train data sets.
  
  #### Data_balance_with_SMOGN.R: Training data sets balancing
  
  #### Determining the thr value and k parameters of SMOGN.R: Determining the thr value and k parameters of SMOGN.
  
  ####  Model hyperparameter tuning and comparison.R: Parameter search and model comparison based on ten-fold cross-validation
  
  ####  Regression model for predicting total generation quantity of HW.R: Regression model based on RF model

  ####  Ensemble model for predicting generation quantity of MHW.R: ensemble model based on RF models
  
  #### Sector_independent model.R: Sector_independent model. Only one industry sector is used as an example in the code.
  
  #### SHAP_analyze.py: compute SHAP values for the model training dataset
  
  #### MAS caculation.R: Calculate the absolute average SHAP value based on the SHAP values to characterize the importance of features.
